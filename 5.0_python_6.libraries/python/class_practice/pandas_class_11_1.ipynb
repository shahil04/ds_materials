For our default dtypes, it seems we decided in the past to simply always return float64, even for rank `method`s that could return ints. \\r\\nFor the ArrowDtype, then, it was decided to keep the dtype returned by pyarrow: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/50264\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now, this PR updates `StringDtype` to simply always return float64, to be consistent between the pyarrow vs python storage. But we could also consider, for those newer dtypes, to actually keep the distinction between float/int results (just not always int like it is done now). ',\n",

Somehow this hasn't been patched since then.\\r\\n\\r\\nPR #48313 was supposed to address this, but the PR was closed and never merged and the bug has persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatch takes two tracks -- it first replaces the `arr == x` with [`np.equals()`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.equal.html) which will handle broadcasting in most cases by itself. For the remainder of cases, an explicit type check is done to return an array for the mask.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] closes #47101\\r\\n- [x] [Tests added and passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#writing-tests) if fixing a bug or adding a new feature\\r\\n- [ ] All [code checks passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#pre-commit).\\r\\n- [x] Added [type annotations](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#type-hints) to new arguments/methods/functions.\\r\\n- [ ] Added an entry in the latest `doc/source/whatsnew/vX.X.X.rst` file if fixing a bug or adding a new feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n----------------\\r\\n\\r\\nHas a KNOWN test failure of\\r\\n\\r\\n> ```\\r\\n> ruff-format.............................................................................................Failed\\r\\n> - hook id: ruff-format\\r\\n> - files were modified by this hook\\r\\n> ```\\r\\n\\r\\nbut I honestly have no clue what's failing in that.

Previously, the method incorrectly returned `True` for groups with all null values in the `timedelta` column. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Changes Made:**\\r\\n- Updated the `_call_cython_op` method to correctly handle `timedelta` columns when computing the `any()` aggregation.\\r\\n- Added a new test case to verify that `groupby().any()` returns `False` for groups where all `timedelta` values are null.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Issue Reference:**\\r\\n- See issue [#59712](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59712) for more details about the bug report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fix ensures that the `groupby().any()` method behaves consistently for `timedelta` columns, aligning with the behavior observed for other data types.\\r\\n',\n",

In a future version, the fill_value must be a valid value for the SparseDtype.subtype.\\r\\n  pd.DataFrame.sparse.from_spmatrix(coo)\\r\\n\\r\\nbut using sparse integer dtype for the scipy matrix does not. I don't understand why this occurs, but it seems like from_spmatrix should be able to handle both of these scenarios. Also, there is no argument to from_spmatrix to specify a type, so it is unclear what the user should do about this future warning if anything. \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nNo warning, uses dtype matching input\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.9.13.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 21.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Mon Aug 22 20:19:52 PDT 2022; root:xnu-8020.140.49~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : None.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 70.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 22.1.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 8.2.2\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.3.7\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\r\\nIPython               : 8.18.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.6.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.0\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.13.1\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

Please construct an ArrowDtype object with a pyarrow_dtype instance with specific parameters.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you inspect the generated file, you see that the pyarrow schema reflects the `fixed_size_list`. e.g `pq.read_metadata(\"using_types_mapper.parquet\").schema.to_arrow_schema()`.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, instead, you do not indicate a types mapper, the type of `fixed_size_list` is lost, and the parquet file on-disk just uses a `list` type:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\nimport pyarrow as pa\\r\\n\\r\\na = pa.array([1, 2, 3])\\r\\nb = pa.array([[True, False, True]] * 3, type=pa.list_(pa.bool_(), 3))\\r\\ntable = pa.Table.from_arrays([a, b], names=[\\'a\\', \\'b\\'])\\r\\n\\r\\npa_table = table.to_pandas() # this is the different line\\r\\npa_table.to_parquet(\"loses_fixed_size.parquet\")\\r\\n\\r\\ndata_frame = pd.read_parquet(\"loses_fixed_size.parquet\")\\r\\ndisplay(pq.read_metadata(\"loses_fixed_size.parquet\").schema.to_arrow_schema())\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI would expect to \\r\\n\\r\\n- read the parquet file without error\\r\\n- for the returned dataframe to have *some kind* of list type for column `b`\\r\\n- for the parquet file\\'s on-disk metadata to still include a `fixed_size_list` type for column `b`\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.11.9.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.5.0-1025-oem\\r\\nVersion               : #26-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Jun 18 12:35:22 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 2.1.1\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 72.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.27.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 17.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

Subclassing dict instead of UserDict is a workaround for this example, but for a variety of complicated reasons (examples: [1](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64646485/823633), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7148602/823633), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64450669/823633)) it is sometimes undesirable to subclass dict.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nThe output should be the same as \\r\\n```python\\r\\npd.DataFrame.from_dict(dict(cd))\\r\\n```\\r\\noutput\\r\\n```\\r\\n   col_1  col_2\\r\\n0      1      3\\r\\n1      2      4\\r\\n```\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.11.9.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 10\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.22000\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 151 Stepping 5, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 72.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.2.1\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\r\\nIPython               : 8.25.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.4\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.8.7\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.13.1\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

Strangely, replacing the division with any other operator also fixes things. I tried this in a clean venv with just the minimal packages installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is similar to older #54542 but different. If I try to run the expression pandas is generating  directly in numexpr I get the same error. Using `sanitize=False` is not enough to make it work however\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport numexpr as ne\\r\\nne.evaluate(\"(np.float64(1.0)) / (np.float64(2.0))\", sanitize=False)\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis leads to a different exception: `AttributeError: \\'VariableNode\\' object has no attribute \\'float64\\'`.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure if this is really a bug in pandas or numexpr.

This issue is unique to `groupby(sort=False)` because for `groupby(sort=True)`, frequencies are sorted within groups; since the denominator of the proportions is the size of each group, their orderings end up being equivalent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the specific case where `groupby` is called with `sort=False`, and `value_counts` is called with `normalize=True` and `sort=True`, this may result in counterintuitive behavior where the `proportion` column is actually NOT sorted. The output of the above example is as follows:\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> import pandas as pd\\r\\n>>> data = {\"by\": [\"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\", \"b\"], \"values\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\\r\\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(data)\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(by=\"by\", sort=False).value_counts(sort=True, normalize=True)\\r\\nby  values\\r\\nb   1         0.500000\\r\\n    0         0.500000\\r\\na   1         0.666667\\r\\n    0         0.333333\\r\\nName: proportion, dtype: float64\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(by=\"by\", sort=False).value_counts(sort=True, normalize=False)\\r\\nby  values\\r\\nb   1         3\\r\\n    0         3\\r\\na   1         2\\r\\n    0         1\\r\\nName: count, dtype: int64\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nGroup `a` has 3 items, so a value appearing 2 times has a proportion of 0.66…. Group `b` has 6 items, so a value appearing 3 times has a proportion of 0.5. IMO when the `sort` flag is passed in this scenario, the sort should be performed on the normalized proportions rather than the frequencies, since under current behavior, passing `sort=True` would result in a frame that isn\\'t actually sorted.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nExisting behavior agrees with documentation, but IMO this existing behavior should be modified to sort on `proportion` rather than un-normalized frequencies to ensure the result frame is sorted.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : 67a58cddc2f8c0e30cb0123589947d9b3f073720\\r\\npython                : 3.11.7\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: Mon Jul 29 21:13:04 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.141.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+1239.g67a58cddc2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 2.1.0.dev0+git20240720.d489c83\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
