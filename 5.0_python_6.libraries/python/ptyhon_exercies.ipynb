    "### Short Notes on Python `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Introduction to Python `for` Loop**\n",
    "A `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over sequences such as lists, strings, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. The loop iterates over each element of the sequence and executes the code inside the loop body for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # body of the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Iterating Over a List**\n",
    "When using a `for` loop with a list, the loop will iterate over each item in the list in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "languages = ['Swift', 'Python', 'Go']\n",
    "\n",
    "for lang in languages:\n",
    "    print(lang)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Swift\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Go\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, the loop iterates over the list `languages` and prints each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Indentation in a `for` Loop**\n",
    "Indentation defines the block of code that belongs to the loop. The body of the loop must be indented consistently. If there is no indentation, Python will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "languages = ['Swift', 'Python', 'Go']\n",
    "\n",
    "for lang in languages:\n",
    "    print(lang)\n",
    "    print('-----')\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Last statement')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- All code inside the loop body is indented, and the `print('Last statement')` is outside the loop because it is not indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Iterating Over a String**\n",
    "A string in Python can be iterated through character by character using a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "language = 'Python'\n",
    "\n",
    "for letter in language:\n",
    "    print(letter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "P\n",
    "y\n",
    "t\n",
    "h\n",
    "o\n",
    "n\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, the loop iterates over each character of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Using `range()` in a `for` Loop**\n",
    "The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be iterated over using a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(4):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `range(4)` generates the numbers 0 to 3. The loop iterates over these numbers and prints them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **`for` Loop with `else` Clause**\n",
    "An `else` clause can be used with a `for` loop. The `else` block is executed after the loop completes its iteration over the sequence, provided that no `break` statement was encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "Loop finished\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Using a `for` Loop Without Accessing Items**\n",
    "You can use a `for` loop without directly accessing the items in the sequence. This is useful when you just need to perform an action a set number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for _ in range(3):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The loop runs three times, but we don't use the variable (indicated by `_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Nested `for` Loops**\n",
    "A `for` loop can be nested within another `for` loop. This allows you to iterate over multiple sequences simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    for j in range(2):\n",
    "        print(f\"i = {i}, j = {j}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "i = 0, j = 0\n",
    "i = 0, j = 1\n",
    "i = 1, j = 0\n",
    "i = 1, j = 1\n",
    "i = 2, j = 0\n",
    "i = 2, j = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The outer loop runs three times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Exiting a Loop Early: `break` Statement**\n",
    "You can use the `break` statement to exit a loop before it finishes iterating over all the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The loop terminates when `i` equals 3 because of the `break` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. **Skipping Iterations: `continue` Statement**\n",
    "The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 2:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "- When `i` equals 2, the `continue` statement is encountered, skipping the rest of the code for that iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python for loop with else clause\n",
    "    - A for loop can have an optional else clause. This else clause executes after the iteration completes.\n",
    "    - Note: The else block will not execute if the for loop is stopped by a break statement.\n",
    "```\n",
    "digits = [0, 1, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in digits:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No items left.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using for loop without accessing items\n",
    " - # using _ for placeholder variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "for _ in languages:\n",
    "    print('Hi')\n",
    "```\n",
    "These are the key concepts of Python's `for` loop. It is a powerful tool for iterating over sequences in Python, making it essential for working with collections of data."

    "- The loop prints numbers 1 to 3 and stops when `number` becomes greater than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Termination of `while` Loop**\n",
    "To prevent an infinite loop, ensure the condition eventually evaluates to `False` by updating variables inside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = int(input('Enter a number: '))\n",
    "\n",
    "while number != 0:\n",
    "    print(f'You entered {number}.')\n",
    "    number = int(input('Enter a number: '))\n",
    "\n",
    "print('The end.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter a number: 3\n",
    "You entered 3.\n",
    "Enter a number: 0\n",
    "The end.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The loop runs until the user inputs `0`, then it terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Infinite `while` Loop**\n",
    "If the loop's condition is always `True`, it forms an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 32\n",
    "\n",
    "while age > 18:\n",
    "    print('You can vote')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can vote\n",
    "You can vote\n",
    "... (infinite)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can create an infinite loop explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    print('You can vote')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Exiting a `while` Loop with `break`**\n",
    "The `break` statement allows you to exit a loop prematurely before the condition becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    if number == 0:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(f'You entered {number}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The loop terminates when the user enters `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **`while` Loop with `else` Clause**\n",
    "An `else` clause can be added to a `while` loop. It executes when the loop finishes normally (i.e., not terminated by a `break` statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while number < 3:\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "    number += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "Loop finished\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `else` block executes after the loop completes all its iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **`for` Loop vs `while` Loop**\n",
    "- **`for` loop**: Used when you know the number of iterations in advance or are iterating over a sequence (like lists, strings).\n",
    "- **`while` loop**: Used when the number of iterations isn't known beforehand and depends on a condition that must be checked repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the key concepts of the Python `while` loop, including its syntax, examples, and different variations such as loops with `break`, `else`, and infinite loops."
