Instead, the Python interpreter automatically invokes them in response to specific actions or operations. For instance, when you use the + operator to add two objects, Python internally calls the __add__ dunder method of the first object.\n","* Operator overloading: A primary use of dunder methods is to enable operator overloading. This allows you to define how standard Python operators (like +, -, *, ==, []) behave when applied to instances of your custom classes.\n","Customizing built-in functions: Dunder methods also allow you to customize the behavior of built-in functions like len(), str(), repr(), int(), and float() when applied to your objects.\n","* Object lifecycle management: Methods like __init__ (constructor) and __del__ (destructor) are dunder methods that control the creation and destruction of objects.\n","* Protocol implementation: Dunder methods define various protocols that objects can adhere to, such as the sequence protocol (e.g., __len__, __getitem__), the numeric protocol (e.g., __add__, __sub__), and the context manager protocol (e.g., __enter__, __exit__).\n","\n","Examples of common dunder methods:\n","- __init__(self, ...): Initializes a new instance of a class.\n","- __str__(self): Returns a user-friendly string representation of an object.\n","- __repr__(self): Returns an unambiguous, developer-focused string representation of an object, often used for debugging.\n","- __add__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the + operator.\n","- __len__(self): Defines the behavior of the len() function.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jIWfKqpIQdlK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","#  Decorators"],"metadata":{"id":"Qm6r0e_XBoJq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def outer_function():\n","    enclosing_var = \"Hello\" # Variable in the enclosing scope\n","\n","    def inner_function():\n","        nonlocal enclosing_var # Declare intent to modify the enclosing variable\n","        enclosing_var = \"World\"\n","        print(f\"Inside inner function: {enclosing_var}\")\n","\n","    inner_function()\n","    print(f\"Inside outer function (after inner function call): {enclosing_var}\")\n","\n","outer_function()"],"metadata":{"id":"z8dN7zMsR9sM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import time\n","\n","def timer(func):\n","    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n","        start = time.time()\n","        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n","        end = time.time()\n","        print(f\"Execution time: {end -
