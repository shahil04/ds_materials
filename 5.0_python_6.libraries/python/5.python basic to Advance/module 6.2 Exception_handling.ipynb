This allows you to signal an error or an unexpected condition within your code, interrupting the normal flow of execution and transferring control to an exception handler.\n","Here's how raise is typically used:\n","Syntax:\n","raise ExceptionType(\"Optional error message\")\n","\n","Explanation:\n","\n","• ExceptionType: This specifies the type of exception you want to raise. Python provides many built-in exception types (e.g., ValueError, TypeError, FileNotFoundError, IndexError), and you can also define custom exception classes.\n","• \"Optional error message\": You can provide a string message that describes the error, which will be part of the exception's details.\n","\n","Common Use Cases:\n","\n","• Signaling invalid input or state: When a function receives arguments that are outside of expected bounds or when an object is in an invalid state.\n","\n","    def calculate_square_root(number):\n","        if number < 0:\n","            raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate square root of a negative number.\")\n","        return number ** 0.5\n","\n","• Re-raising exceptions: You can catch an exception, perform some actions (like logging), and then re-raise the same or a different exception to propagate it further up the call stack for handling by higher-level code. [1]  \n","\n","    try:\n","        # Some operation that might fail\n","        result = 10 / 0\n","    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n","        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n","        raise # Re-raises the caught ZeroDivisionError\n","\n","Relationship with try...except:\n","raise is often used in conjunction with try...except blocks. When an exception is raised, Python searches for an appropriate except block to handle it. If no matching except block is found in the current scope, the exception propagates up the call stack until it is handled or the program terminates.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4128qRhzUH7u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Ahdc4azRQFdC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Custom Error define\n","\n","---\n","\n","• Custom exceptions: You can define your own exception classes to represent specific error conditions in your application, making your code more readable and maintainable.\n","\n","    class CustomError(Exception):\n","        pass\n","\n","    def process_data(data):\n","        if not data:\n","            raise CustomError(\"Data cannot be empty.\")\n","        # Process data\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"n8dWI0dTQLGr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# create user define custom Exceptions\n","\n","class Below18AgeExcptionError(Exception):\n","    pass"],"metadata":{"id":"LiKkVe7TdZDO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["age =14\n","try:\n","  if age<=18:\n","    raise Below18AgeExcptionError(\"you are not eligible\")\n","  else:\n","    print(\"you are eligible\")\n","except Below18AgeExcptionError as e:\n","\n","  print(\"error: \", e)\n","\n","print(\"run all code\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UYKEH4iGeCsc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751256375072,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":95,"user":{"displayName":"Sahil","userId":"02943187861823395646"}},"outputId":"5d8852b7-993a-4393-922e-991164ee716d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["error:  you are not eligible\n","run all code\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"D1lvZq99dtVI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"H73gheNllFpA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/exception-handling\n","# extra notes\n","# https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/user-defined-exception\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BhiEOET8nsLY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
