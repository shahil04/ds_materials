What is `__name__` in Python?\n","\n","In every Python file, there is a special built-in variable called `__name__`.\n","\n","* When you **run a Python file directly**, Python sets `__name__` to `\"__main__\"` in that file.\n","* When you **import a Python file into another**, Python sets `__name__` to the **filename** (module name), not `\"__main__\"`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ✅ 2.
