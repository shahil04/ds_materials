File**\n","\n","* **Definition**: A single `.py` file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables, etc.).\n","* **Purpose**: It's the basic unit of code.\n","* **Example**:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # file: math_utils.py\n","  def add(a, b):\n","      return a + b\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ✅ **2. Module**\n","\n","* **Definition**: A module is **any single Python file** (with `.py` extension) that can be **imported and used** in another script.\n","* **Purpose**: Reuse code by importing.\n","* **Example**:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import math_utils\n","  print(math_utils.add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ✅ **3. Package**\n","\n","* **Definition**: A **folder** that contains **multiple modules or sub-packages**, and has an `__init__.py` file.\n","* **Purpose**: Organize related modules together.\n","* **Structure**:\n","\n","  ```\n","  my_package/\n","  ├── __init__.py\n","  ├── math_utils.py\n","  └── string_utils.py\n","  ```\n","* **Example Usage**:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  from my_package import math_utils\n","  math_utils.add(2, 3)\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ✅ **4. Library**\n","\n","* **Definition**: A **collection of packages and modules** that provide specific functionality.\n","* **Purpose**: Solve common problems without writing code from scratch.\n","* **Examples**:\n","\n","  * `NumPy` – numerical operations\n","  * `Pandas` – data analysis\n","  * `Matplotlib` – data visualization\n","  * `Requests` – HTTP requests\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ✅ **5. Framework**\n","\n","* **Definition**: A **complete structure** or ecosystem for building software (e.g., web apps, ML apps). It includes multiple **libraries**, tools, and **conventions**.\n","* **Purpose**: Build full applications with a predefined structure.\n","* **Examples**:\n","\n","  * `Django` – web framework (built using Python)\n","  * `Flask` – micro web framework\n","  * `TensorFlow` – ML framework\n","  * `FastAPI` – API framework\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 📊 Summary Table\n","\n","| Term      | Description                         | Example                         |\n","| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n","| File      | A `.py` file with code              | `math_utils.py`                 |\n","| Module    | A Python file you can import        | `import math_utils`             |\n","| Package   | Folder with modules + `__init__.py` | `my_package.math_utils`         |\n","| Library   | Collection of packages/modules      | `Pandas`, `NumPy`               |\n","| Framework | Complete app-building toolset       | `Django`, `Flask`, `TensorFlow` |\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"j3nx3hdZVmw8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"1FwuFJ6jTYZi"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
