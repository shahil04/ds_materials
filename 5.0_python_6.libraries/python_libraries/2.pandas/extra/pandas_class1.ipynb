It provides powerful tools that simplify tasks like data filtering, transforming, and merging.\n","\n","   It also provides built-in functions to work with formats like CSV, JSON, TXT, Excel, and SQL databases.\n","\n","2. **Tabular Data Representation**\n","\n","   Pandas DataFrames, the primary data structure of Pandas, handle data in tabular format. This allows easy indexing, selecting, replacing, and slicing of data.\n","\n","3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**\n","\n","   Data cleaning and preprocessing are essential steps in the data analysis pipeline, and Pandas provides powerful tools to facilitate these tasks. It has methods for handling missing values, removing duplicates, handling outliers, data normalization, etc.\n","\n","4. **Time Series Functionality**\n","\n","   Pandas contains an extensive set of tools for working with dates, times, and time-indexed data as it was initially developed for financial modeling.\n","\n","5. **Free and Open-Source**\n","\n","   Pandas follows the same principles as Python, allowing you to use and distribute Pandas for free, even for commercial use.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nw2wKp9nzEf6"},"source":["## 🧠 1.
