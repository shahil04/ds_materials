    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that combines Spotify track analytics and YouTube video performance metrics to understand how musical attributes relate to audience engagement. The dashboard enables users to analyze trends, compare performance across platforms, and make data-driven decisions in music production, marketing, and audience targeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Music creators and marketing teams often struggle to correlate a song’s audio characteristics (like energy, tempo, danceability) with its real-world audience engagement (views, likes, comments). Additionally, performance is spread across multiple platforms, making it difficult to get a unified view.\n",
    "This dashboard solves this by integrating Spotify and YouTube data to help identify which attributes contribute to higher engagement and streaming popularity.\n",
