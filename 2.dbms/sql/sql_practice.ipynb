    "Here are **three questions** for each subtopic (**Views, CTE, and Window Functions**) based on the **Sakila** database, which is a commonly used sample database for MySQL. Each question includes detailed explanations and examples to enhance your understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Views**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Question**: How can you create a view in the Sakila database to get customer details along with their rental history?\n",
    "   **Explanation**: You can use a **view** to simplify a query that joins multiple tables, such as retrieving customer information along with their rental data from the `customer` and `rental` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE VIEW customer_rental_history AS\n",
    "   SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, r.rental_date, f.title\n",

    "   JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id\n",
    "   JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Usage**:\n",
    "   - After creating this view, you can easily query the rental history for customers without joining multiple tables each time.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM customer_rental_history WHERE last_name = 'SMITH';\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Question**: How can you create a view to show the total amount paid by each customer in the Sakila database?\n",
    "   **Explanation**: A **view** can be created to show the total amount of payments made by each customer by joining the `payment` and `customer` tables and aggregating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Usage**:\n",
    "   - You can now easily get the total payments made by any customer by querying this view.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Question**: How can you create a view to restrict sensitive information, such as payment details, from the Sakila database?\n",
    "   **Explanation**: You can use a view to **restrict access** to sensitive columns, such as credit card information or payment amounts, exposing only the necessary details like customer names and rental history.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE VIEW public_rental_info AS\n",

    "Window functions in SQL are extremely powerful for performing calculations across rows that are related to the current row. Unlike regular aggregate functions, which group rows and return a single result per group, window functions allow for calculations across a set of rows that maintain the context of each individual row.\n",

    "### 1. **What is a Window Function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **window function** performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This set of rows is referred to as the \"window.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Window functions do not cause rows to be grouped into a single result.\n",
    "- They return a value for each row in the result set.\n",
    "- They allow the use of aggregate-like functions (like `SUM`, `AVG`, `RANK`, etc.) without collapsing rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Syntax of Window Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of a window function in MySQL looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "<function_name>(<expression>) OVER (\n",
    "    [PARTITION BY <column>]\n",
    "    [ORDER BY <expression>]\n",
    "    [ROWS or RANGE between <frame_start> AND <frame_end>]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `function_name`: The function you want to apply (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `RANK`, etc.).\n",
    "- `PARTITION BY`: Defines the window or subset of rows over which the function operates, similar to a `GROUP BY` but without collapsing the result set.\n",
    "- `ORDER BY`: Defines the order of rows in the window.\n",
    "- `ROWS or RANGE`: Defines the frame of rows within the partition to consider for the function, relative to the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Types of Window Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions fall into several categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregate Functions**: These perform aggregation across a specified range of rows (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example: \n",
    "   - `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name)`\n",
    "   - `AVG() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ranking Functions**: These assign a rank or row number to rows within the partition.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Common Ranking Functions:\n",
    "   - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique row number starting from 1 within the partition.\n",
    "   - `RANK()`: Assigns ranks, with gaps if there are ties.\n",
    "   - `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns ranks without gaps even in case of ties.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Value Functions**: These allow you to access the value of a column relative to the current row.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Common Value Functions:\n",
    "   - `LEAD()`: Returns the value from a subsequent row.\n",
    "   - `LAG()`: Returns the value from a preceding row.\n",
    "   - `FIRST_VALUE()`: Returns the first value in the partition.\n",
    "   - `LAST_VALUE()`: Returns the last value in the partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analytic Functions**: These are advanced calculations like cumulative sums or moving averages.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Examples:\n",
    "   - `CUME_DIST()`: Returns the cumulative distribution of a value within the partition.\n",
    "   - `NTILE(n)`: Divides the result set into `n` buckets.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **PARTITION BY Clause**\n",

    "   This partitions the `payment` table by `customer_id` and calculates the total amount paid by each customer.\n",

    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT rental_id, rental_date, \n",

    "   FROM rental;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ROWS or RANGE Clause**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Defines the range of rows around the current row to include in the calculation. This is useful for things like running totals or sliding window aggregates.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `ROWS` refers to a physical number of rows before or after the current row.\n",

    "### 6. **Use Cases of Window Functions in Data Science and Analytics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Running Totals**: Useful in finance and accounting for tracking cumulative totals, like account balances or cumulative sales.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example: Running total of sales per day for each product.\n",

    "- **Ranking**: Window functions are heavily used in recommendation systems, ranking products, movies, or users based on certain criteria (e.g., most purchased, most watched).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example: Rank products by total sales or customers by their lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moving Averages**: Used in time series analysis to smooth out fluctuations in the data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example: Calculate the 7-day moving average for website traffic or stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lag and Lead**: These are used to compare current values with previous or next values. Common in sequential data analysis, like stock prices, sensor data, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example: Compare today's stock price with yesterday's stock price to compute daily changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percentile Rankings**: Calculate the percentile rank of a value within a group, useful in test scoring, customer segmentation, and more.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example: Determine the percentile rank of students based on their test scores.\n",

    "Window functions in SQL are indispensable for advanced data analysis. They provide the ability to perform complex calculations without collapsing rows, making them perfect for tasks like ranking, cumulative totals, and time series analysis. When combined with partitioning, ordering, and framing clauses, they become an essential tool for both data scientists and analysts to derive meaningful insights from their data."
