measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (the outcome or response variable) that is explained by the independent variables (predictors) in a regression model.

A high \\( R^2 \\) can also occur if the model is overfitting, i.e., it captures noise in the data as if it were a meaningful pattern.\n","\n","3. **Limitations**:\n","   - \\( R^2 \\) does not imply causation; it only quantifies the fit of the model.\n","   - It can increase if more predictors are added to the model, even if the added predictors are not genuinely useful (this is why adjusted \\( R^2 \\) is often used for multiple regression).\n","   - It doesn't capture the possibility of a poor model fit when other diagnostic measures (like residual analysis) suggest otherwise.\n","\n","### Formula for \\( R^2 \\):\n","\\[\n","R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)}}{\\text{Total Sum of Squares (SST)}}\n","\\]\n","Where:\n","- SSR (Sum of Squared Residuals) is the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.\n","- SST (Total Sum of Squares) is the sum of squared differences between the observed values and their mean.\n","\n","In simple terms, \\( R^2 \\) tells you how much better your model is at explaining the variation in the data compared to a baseline model (which simply predicts the mean of the dependent variable for all observations)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wUgUsDOmpC2Z"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"aienv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.9"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
