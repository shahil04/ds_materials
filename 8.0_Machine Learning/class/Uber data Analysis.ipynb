Understand the **overall trip behavior**.\n","2. Identify **patterns and trends** in ride usage.\n","3. Explore **seasonal and time-based variations**.\n","4. Compare **trip purposes and categories**.\n","5. Detect **outliers or anomalies** (e.g., very long trips).\n","6. Provide **actionable insights** for Uber’s business strategy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 💡 **Key Business Questions for EDA**\n","\n","### 🕒 1. Time-based Analysis\n","\n","* What is the **total number of trips per day/week/month**?\n","* Which **days of the week** have the most Uber trips?\n","* What are the **peak hours** for Uber rides (morning, evening, late night)?\n","* How does the **ride frequency vary over time** (seasonal trends)?\n","* Are there any **particular months or dates** with unusual activity?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 📍 2. Location-based Analysis\n","\n","* Which **pickup locations (START)** are most common?\n","* Which **drop locations (STOP)** are most frequent?\n","* What are the **top origin-destination pairs**?\n","* Do riders tend to **travel within the same city** or **between cities**?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🧭 3. Distance and Duration Insights\n","\n","* What is the **average distance (miles)** per trip?\n","* Which trips are **shortest and longest**?\n","* Is there a **relationship between trip distance and time**?\n","* How do **business trips** differ from **personal trips** in terms of distance?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🏢 4. Category and Purpose Analysis\n","\n","* What proportion of rides are **Business** vs **Personal**?\n","* What are the **top purposes** for business trips (e.g., Customer Visit, Meeting, Errand)?\n","* Are **Business rides longer or shorter** on average compared to Personal rides?\n","* Do certain **purposes** happen at specific times of day (e.g., “Meeting” rides during office hours)?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 📈 5. Driver and Operational Efficiency\n","\n","* How many **total miles** were driven overall?\n","* What is the **average miles per day**?\n","* Are there **idle days** (no rides)?\n","* Are there **patterns of frequent short rides** vs **few long rides**?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ⚠️ 6. Data Quality and Anomalies\n","\n","* Are there any **missing values** in PURPOSE or CATEGORY?\n","* Any **negative or zero miles** that need cleaning?\n","* Are there **duplicate trips** or incorrect timestamps?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 💰 7. Potential Business Recommendations\n","\n","After performing EDA, you could generate insights like:\n","\n","* Suggest **incentives** for high-demand times or routes.\n","* Identify **popular travel corridors** to place surge pricing.\n","* Recommend **driver shifts** based on demand peaks.\n","* Understand how **business vs personal rides** contribute to revenue.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🧮 **Next Steps After EDA**\n","\n","Once the EDA is complete, you can:\n","\n","1. Build a **Power BI or Tableau dashboard** showing interactive trip insights.\n","2. Use **Machine Learning** to predict:\n","\n","   * Trip demand by hour/day.\n","   * Average distance or ride duration.\n","   * Customer segmentation by travel purpose.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"U30eT39TqI9i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.
