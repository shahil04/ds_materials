Perfect 👍 You want a **landing page for a technical institute** that looks like IT Vedant or PW Skills, featuring:
✅ Course Offers Section
✅ Enquiry Form (Name, Email, Mobile)
✅ Sidebar Navigation (like screenshot)
✅ Google Review Button
✅ WhatsApp Chat Icon
✅ Chatbot Floating Icon

Here’s what I’ll include in your **basic, responsive website** (HTML + CSS + JS version):

### 🧱 Website Structure

```

```

Before I generate and zip this **complete website**, please confirm:

1. What is your **institute name** (e.g., “AI Mind Tech”)?
2. Do you want me to:

   * Keep it as a **static site** (HTML/CSS/JS only)
   * Or include a **Python Flask backend** (for storing enquiries)?
3. Should I add **real links** (e.g., WhatsApp, Google Review, Mail) or leave placeholders?

Once confirmed, I’ll create and share a **ready-to-run zip file** of your landing page.
