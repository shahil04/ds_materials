To connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell, follow these steps:

### **1. Open MySQL Shell**
- On **Windows**, open the command prompt (`cmd`) and type:
  ```sh
  mysqlsh
  ```
- On **Linux/Mac**, open the terminal and type:
  ```sh
  mysqlsh
  ```

### **2. Connect to MySQL Server**
#### **Option 1: Connect using root user (or any other user)**
```sh
\connect root@localhost
```
or
```sh
\c root@localhost
```
You'll be prompted for a password.

#### **Option 2: Connect using a specific host and port**
```sh
\connect root@127.0.0.1:3306
```
or
```sh
\connect root@hostname:port
```
Replace `hostname` and `port` accordingly.

#### **Option 3: Connect with password inline (not recommended for security reasons)**
```sh
\connect root@localhost --password=yourpassword
```

#### **Option 4: Connect to a remote MySQL server**
```sh
\connect username@remote_host -p
```
You'll be prompted to enter the password.

### **3. Verify the Connection**
Once connected, you'll see a prompt like:
```
MySQL Shell 8.0.30
Copyright (c) 2016, 2024, Oracle and/or its affiliates.
Type '\help' or '\?' for help.

mysql-js>
```
If you want to switch to SQL mode, type:
```sh
\sql
```
