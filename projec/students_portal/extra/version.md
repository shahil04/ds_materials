## 🔐 Why Django 4.2 LTS?

* Official LTS (supported until April 2026)
* Stable APIs
* Best balance of modern features and long-term support
* Compatible with Django packages like REST framework, AllAuth, etc.

👉 **Avoid Django 5.x in production** unless you're familiar with its new changes and are ready to actively maintain it.

---

## 🔧 Install Example

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install "django==4.2.*" psycopg2-binary gunicorn

python -m django --version
```

---

## ✅ Recommendation Summary

> ✅ **Use: `Python 3.11 + Django 4.2 LTS + PostgreSQL 15`**
> It’s the most stable, well-supported, and scalable setup for a long-term Django-based production app.

Would you like me to:

* Generate a **basic Django 4.2 LTS student portal boilerplate**?
* Create a **requirements.txt and Docker setup** for these versions?
* Guide on **setting up PostgreSQL and Gunicorn locally or on cloud**?

Let me know and I’ll proceed accordingly.
