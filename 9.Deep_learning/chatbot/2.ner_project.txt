Excellent 🔥 — Let’s build a Machine Learning–based Intent Classifier Chatbot for a Restaurant Booking Assistant (with Named Entity Recognition for extracting details like date, time, people, etc.).

You’ll get

 ✅ Intent classification model (ML-based)
 ✅ NER extraction (using spaCy)
 ✅ FastAPI or Streamlit interface
 ✅ Downloadable ZIP (complete project)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a chatbot that can handle conversations like

 Book a table for 2 at 8 PM tomorrow
 Cancel my reservation for today evening
 What's the restaurant address
 Do you serve vegan food

It will

1. Classify the user’s intent (book_table, cancel_reservation, restaurant_info, menu_query, etc.)
2. Extract entities like number of people, date, time.

## 🧩 Step 1 intents.json

```json
{
  intents [
    {intent book_table, patterns [Book a table, I need a reservation, Reserve for two people, Table for 4 tonight]},
    {intent cancel_reservation, patterns [Cancel my booking, Cancel reservation, I want to cancel my table]},
    {intent restaurant_info, patterns [Where is the restaurant, Address please, What’s your location]},
    {intent menu_query, patterns [Show me the menu, Do you serve vegan, What dishes do you have]},
    {intent greeting, patterns [Hi, Hello, Hey there, Good morning]},
    {intent goodbye, patterns [Bye, See you, Good night, Thanks]}
  ]
}
```

---

## 🧠 Step 2 Intent Classifier — `train_intent_model.py`

```python
import json
import joblib
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load intents
with open(intents.json) as f
    data = json.load(f)

texts = []
labels = []

for item in data[intents]
    for pattern in item[patterns]
        texts.append(pattern)
        labels.append(item[intent])

# TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, labels)

# Save
joblib.dump(model, intent_model.pkl)
joblib.dump(vectorizer, vectorizer.pkl)

print(✅ Intent classification model trained and saved!)
```

---

## 🔍 Step 3 Named Entity Recognition — `ner_extractor.py`

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load(en_core_web_sm)

def extract_entities(text)
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = {}
    for ent in doc.ents
        entities[ent.label_] = ent.text
    return entities
```

---

## 💬 Step 4 Chatbot Logic — `chatbot.py`

```python
import joblib
from ner_extractor import extract_entities

model = joblib.load(intent_model.pkl)
vectorizer = joblib.load(vectorizer.pkl)

def predict_intent(text)
    X = vectorizer.transform([text])
    return model.predict(X)[0]

def chatbot_response(text)
    intent = predict_intent(text)
    entities = extract_entities(text)

    if intent == book_table
        return fGot it! Booking a table. Details {entities if entities else 'Please provide date and time.'}
    elif intent == cancel_reservation
        return Your reservation has been canceled.
    elif intent == restaurant_info
        return Our restaurant is located at MG Road, Bengaluru.
    elif intent == menu_query
        return We serve Italian, Indian, and Continental dishes. Vegan options available!
    elif intent == greeting
        return Hello! 👋 How can I help you today
    elif intent == goodbye
        return Goodbye! Have a great day! 👋
    else
        return I'm not sure how to respond to that.
```

## 🖥️ Step 5 Streamlit App — `app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st
from chatbot import chatbot_response

st.set_page_config(page_title=Restaurant Chatbot, page_icon=🍽️, layout=centered)

st.title(🍽️ Restaurant Booking Assistant)
st.write(Ask me about booking, cancellation, menu, or location!)

if chat not in st.session_state
    st.session_state.chat = []

user_input = st.chat_input(Type your message here...)

if user_input
    bot_reply = chatbot_response(user_input)
    st.session_state.chat.append((You, user_input))
    st.session_state.chat.append((Bot, bot_reply))

for sender, msg in st.session_state.chat
    if sender == You
        st.markdown(f🧑‍💻 {sender} {msg})
    else
        st.markdown(f🤖 {sender} {msg})
```
