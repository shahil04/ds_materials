# 🚀 Google App Engine (GAE) — Crash Course + Deployment Steps

---

## 🌐 What is Google App Engine?

> **App Engine** is a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** offered by Google Cloud that allows you to **deploy web applications without managing servers**.

### ✅ Why use App Engine?

* No server management
* Scales automatically
* Built-in monitoring and logging
* Supports Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.
* Good for Flask/Django ML apps and APIs

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term                     | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Environment** | Lightweight, auto-scaling environment (e.g., Python, Node.js) |
| **App.yaml**             | Config file that tells GAE how to run your app                |
| **Service**              | A deployed microservice in your App Engine project            |
| **Versioning**           | Deploy multiple versions and switch between them              |
| **`gcloud` CLI**         | Used to deploy and manage your app from your terminal         |

---

## ✅ 1. Prerequisites

1. **Python installed** (3.9, 3.10, or 3.11)
2. **Flask App** (with `app.py`, HTML, and model files)
3. **Google Cloud SDK installed**
   ➤ [Install SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
4. **Google Cloud project created**
   ➤ [Create Project](https://console.cloud.google.com)

---

## 🔧 2. Install & Initialize Google Cloud SDK

```bash
gcloud init
gcloud auth login
```

Set your default project and region during setup.

---

## 📁 3. Project Structure (Example)

```
flask_app/
├── app.py
├── app.yaml
├── model.pkl
├── vectorizer.pkl
├── nltk_data/
│   └── corpora/
│       ├── stopwords/
│       └── wordnet/
├── requirements.txt
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
```

---

## 📄 4. Create `app.yaml`

```yaml
runtime: python310
entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT app:app

handlers:
  - url: /static
    static_dir: static

  - url: /.*
    script: auto
```

---

## 📦 5. Prepare `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Make sure it contains:

```txt
Flask
gunicorn
nltk
scikit-learn
```

---

## 📌 6. Bundle NLTK Data (if used)

Download and copy into project:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

Then copy folders into:

```
nltk_data/corpora/stopwords/
nltk_data/corpora/wordnet/
```

And in `app.py`:

```python
import nltk
nltk.data.path.append('./nltk_data')
```

---

## 🚀 7. Deploy to App Engine

### Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd flask_app
```

### Deploy the app:

```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

### Open your app:

```bash
gcloud app browse
```

---

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

| Command                                   | Description                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `gcloud app deploy`                       | Deploy app to GAE                |
| `gcloud app browse`                       | Open the deployed app in browser |
| `gcloud app logs tail -s default`         | Real-time logs                   |
| `gcloud app versions list`                | List all versions                |
| `gcloud app versions delete <VERSION_ID>` | Delete a version                 |

---

## 🧹 Cleaning Up (To avoid billing)

```bash
gcloud app services delete default
```

Or shut down project:

```bash
gcloud projects delete <PROJECT_ID>
```

---

## ✅ Final Tips

* **Don’t use `nltk.download()` in production** — always bundle `nltk_data/`
* Use **`gunicorn`** in production (not Flask’s built-in server)
* You get **free tier** per month on App Engine (useful for demo/test apps)

---
🛠️ Useful Commands
Command	Description
gcloud app deploy	Deploy app to GAE
gcloud app browse	Open the deployed app in browser
gcloud app logs tail -s default	Real-time logs
gcloud app versions list	List all versions
gcloud app versions delete <VERSION_ID>	Delete a version

Let me know if you'd like:

* A sample GitHub repo
* API version (for ML model prediction)
* CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for GCP deployment

## ANOTHER WAY TO HOST IN GCP
---

Yes! If you want more **visibility and control over your files** (unlike App Engine's sandboxed deployment), there are several **alternative ways** to deploy your Flask app on GCP or elsewhere. Here's a breakdown of options:

---

## ✅ 1. **Use Google Cloud Run (Recommended Alternative)**

**🔹 What is Cloud Run?**
A fully managed serverless platform that runs containers — you have full control over your files, Dockerfile, dependencies, and environment.

**🔹 Benefits:**

* Files are packaged in a Docker container (you know exactly what's deployed)
* Logs, scaling, custom domains — all supported
* You can access Cloud Storage or Databases easily

**🔹 High-level Steps:**

1. Create `Dockerfile` for your Flask app
2. Use `gcloud builds submit` to deploy
3. Get a public URL to access

> If you want, I can generate a ready-to-use `Dockerfile` for your current Flask app.

---

## ✅ 2. **Use Google Compute Engine (Full VM)**

**🔹 What is it?**
You get a **virtual machine** (VM) running Ubuntu/Windows — just like your local system.

**🔹 Benefits:**

* You can SSH in, upload files via SCP or SFTP
* Install Python, Flask, NLTK, manually set everything
* Full control over server behavior

**🔹 Downsides:**

* You manage everything: ports, security, uptime
* Not serverless, and less scalable than App Engine or Cloud Run

---

## ✅ 3. **Use Cloud Storage + Streamlit or Flask on Cloud Run**

If your goal is mainly **inference (prediction)** and **model files need to be separate**, you can:

* Store model files (`model.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl`) in **Google Cloud Storage**
* Deploy the app using **Cloud Run** or **App Engine**
* Load models at runtime from GCS

---

## ✅ 4. **Use Other Hosting Platforms (If GCP is too complex)**

* **Render** – Easy Flask app hosting with free tier
  [https://render.com/](https://render.com/)
* **Railway** – Developer-friendly, deploys from GitHub
  [https://railway.app/](https://railway.app/)
* **Vercel/Netlify + Flask via Serverless Functions** – Limited, but possible
* **Heroku (deprecated free tier)** – Easy but now paid

## 🔚 Which to Use?

| Option          | Best For                 | Files Access | Effort | Scalability |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ------ | ----------- |
| App Engine      | Beginners                | ❌ Hidden     | Low    | High        |
| Cloud Run       | Full control, serverless | ✅ Full       | Medium | High        |
| Compute Engine  | Full VM control          | ✅ Full       | High   | Manual      |
| Render/Railway  | Simplicity               | ✅ Full       | Low    | Medium      |
| GCS + Cloud Run | Model separation         | ✅ Full       | Medium | High        |

Would you like me to help you switch your current Flask app to **Cloud Run** or another method like **Render** with full visibility into files?
