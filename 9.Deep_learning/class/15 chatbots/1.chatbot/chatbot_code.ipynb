    "\n",
    "A **chatbot** is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users through text or voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Responds to user input automatically\n",
    "* Follows rules, NLP, or AI\n",
    "* Works on websites, apps, messaging platforms\n",
    "* Can be specialized (customer support) or general (personal assistant)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Chatbots Are Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 24/7 support\n",
    "* Extremely cost-effective\n",
    "* Improves user engagement\n",
    "* Automates repetitive tasks\n",
