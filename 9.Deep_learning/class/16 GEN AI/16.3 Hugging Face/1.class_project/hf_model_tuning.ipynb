        "### 1. Introduction to Hugging Face and its Core Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "Hugging Face is a company and open-source community focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is best known for its **Transformers library**, which offers tools and pre-trained models for a wide range of NLP tasks. Beyond Transformers, Hugging Face also provides other widely used libraries, including **Datasets** and **Tokenizers**. It also features a **Model Hub** for sharing and downloading pre-trained models, datasets, and other resources, and **Spaces** for hosting and sharing machine learning demos and applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Libraries:**\n",
        "*   **Transformers Library**: The core library for pre-trained models and pipelines, providing access to thousands of pre-trained models for NLP tasks like translation, text summarization, and text classification. It is simple to use with complex NLP models, offers cutting-edge models, supports customization, and has a large, active community.\n",
        "*   **Datasets Library**: Provides easy access to a wide variety of datasets for NLP and other machine learning tasks. It enables efficient work with large datasets through lazy loading and streaming, offers a unified API for processing datasets, and integrates well with the Transformers library and other ML frameworks. Hugging Face provides over 350,000 datasets on its platform.\n",
        "*   **Tokenizers Library**: A fast, efficient, and flexible library designed for tokenizing text data, a crucial step in NLP. Tokenization involves splitting text into smaller units (words, subwords, characters) and converting them into numerical representations for ML models. It is optimised for fast tokenization, supports custom tokenizers, and integrates with other Hugging Face libraries like Transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Hugging Face Access Token\n",
        "\n",
        "An access token (also referred to as an API key) is a secure string of characters used to access Hugging Face services and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When an Access Token is Needed:**\n",
        "*   When using a private or \"gated\" model (e.g., Meta's LLaMA) or an Inference API.\n",
        "*   When uploading models, datasets, or Spaces to the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When an Access Token is NOT Needed:**\n",
        "*   When accessing public models (e.g., GPT-2) which are freely available to download and use without authentication.\n",
        "*   When using models via the Transformers library, as many are publicly available and downloadable without an API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create an access token, you need to create an account on the official Hugging Face website (`huggingface.co/join`), then navigate to your profile, select \"Access Tokens,\" and create a new token. It is crucial **not to share** your access tokens with anyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Installing Hugging Face Libraries on Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Colab is a free web application that can be used to run Python notebooks. You can easily install Hugging Face libraries there.\n",
        "\n",
        "**General Installation Command:**\n",
        "The general command to install libraries using `pip` (a Python package manager) on Google Colab includes an exclamation mark (`!`) at the beginning.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# General command to install a library on Google Colab\n",
        "!pip install <library_name>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific Installation Commands:**\n",
        "*   **Transformers Library**: `!pip install transformers`\n",
        "*   **Datasets Library**: `!pip install datasets`\n",
        "*   **Tokenizers Library**: `!pip install tokenizers`\n",
        "*   **PyTorch (often required for models)**: `!pip install torch`\n",
        "*   **Diffusers Library (for text-to-image/video)**: `!pip install diffusers`\n",
        "\n",
        "You can change the runtime type on Google Colab (e.g., to T4 GPU or V2-8 TPU for complex projects) for better efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Downloading a Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "The `datasets` library allows easy access to a wide variety of datasets for machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example: Downloading the IMDB Dataset**\n",

        "*   **`train`**: Contains 25,000 rows with features like 'text' (movie reviews) and 'label' (sentiment: positive or negative).\n",
        "*   **`test`**: Contains 25,000 rows for testing, with the same features.\n",
        "*   The 'unsupervised' split (50,000 rows) is often used for pre-training or semi-supervised learning and typically lacks labels.\n",

        "    *   *Examples:* \"This is pathetic, so frustrating\" (anger), \"I'm thrilled about the results\" (joy).\n",
        "*   **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Analyses sentiment towards specific aspects of a product or service.\n",
        "    *   *Example:* \"The food was great but the service was slow\" (positive for food, negative for service).\n",
        "*   **Intent Analysis**: Detects the user's intention, e.g., to purchase or complain.\n",
