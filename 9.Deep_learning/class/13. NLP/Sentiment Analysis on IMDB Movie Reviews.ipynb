By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this project will help businesses, film studios, and media analysts understand public opinion and improve decision-making related to movie marketing, production, and audience engagement.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Business Need / Problem Statement:**\n","\n","In the entertainment industry, understanding audience feedback is crucial for success. Movie reviews on platforms such as IMDB contain valuable insights into customer preferences, emotional responses, and satisfaction levels. However, the vast volume of unstructured text data makes manual analysis inefficient and error-prone.\n","This project addresses this challenge by automating sentiment detection, enabling stakeholders to:\n","\n","* Quickly gauge audience reactions.\n","* Identify key factors influencing movie ratings.\n","* Enhance marketing and content strategies based on real-time sentiment trends.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Objectives:**\n","\n","1. **Develop** a sentiment analysis model to classify IMDB reviews as *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*.\n","2. **Preprocess** and clean large-scale textual data for efficient analysis.\n","3. **Apply** machine learning and deep learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy and performance.\n","4. **Visualize** sentiment trends and insights using dashboards or visual tools.\n","5. **Support** decision-making in movie marketing and audience analytics.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Scope:**\n","\n","* **Data Source:** IMDB movie review dataset.\n","* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, Matplotlib/Seaborn.\n","* **Deliverables:**\n","\n","  * Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.\n","  * Trained sentiment classification model.\n","  * Accuracy and performance reports.\n","  * Visualization dashboard or summary report.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Business Value / Impact:**\n","\n","* **Enhanced Market Insights:** Understand how audiences perceive different genres, actors, and storylines.\n","* **Improved Decision-Making:** Enable production houses to make data-driven content and marketing choices.\n","* **Reputation Management:** Quickly detect negative sentiments and respond effectively.\n","* **Competitive Advantage:** Use sentiment insights to predict box office performance and refine strategies.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Potential Stakeholders:**\n","\n","* Film Production Companies\n","* Marketing & PR Teams\n","* Streaming Platforms\n","* Data Analytics Firms\n","* Audience Research Departments\n","\n","---\n","\n","Would you like me to add a **“Technical Overview”** section next (including model architecture, data preprocessing steps, and algorithm choices)? That would make it suitable for an academic or professional project report.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9LsOh7E-GPZC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h4cLMpWQTLiN"},"source":["### **Step 1:

of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\n"]}],"source":["### **Step 3: Basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**\n","\n","\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Check data balance\n","sns.countplot(x='sentiment', data=df)\n","plt.title(\"Sentiment Distribution\")\n","plt.show()\n","\n","print(df['review'][0])\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ivzZVMwVTke0"},"outputs":[],"source":["### **Step 4: Data Preprocessing**\n","\n","# We'll clean text and convert labels (`positive`/`negative`) to numerical form.\n","\n","\n","import re\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","\n","# Clean the text\n","def clean_text(text):\n","    text = re.sub('<.*?>', '', text)  #
