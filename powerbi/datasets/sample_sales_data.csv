### DAX Formulas for Analysis

1. **Total Sales**
   ```DAX
   Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
   ```

2. **Average Sales per Salesperson**
   ```DAX
"   Average Sales per Salesperson = AVERAGEX(SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Salesperson], ""Sales"", SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])), [Sales])"
   ```

3. **Total Profit**
   ```DAX
   Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
   ```

4. **Sales by Region**
   ```DAX
"   Sales by Region = SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Region], ""Total Sales"", SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]))"
   ```

5. **Top Performing Salesperson**
   ```DAX
"   Top Salesperson = TOPN(1, SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Salesperson], ""Total Sales"", SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])), [Total Sales], DESC)"
   ```

6. **Product Performance**
   ```DAX
"   Sales by Product = SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Product], ""Total Sales"", SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]))"
   ```

7. **Monthly Sales**
   ```DAX
"   Monthly Sales = SUMMARIZE(Sales, FORMAT(Sales[Date], ""YYYY-MM""), ""Total Sales"", SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]))"
   ```

8. **Unique Customers**
   ```DAX
   Unique Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerID])
   ```

9. **Profit Margin**
   ```DAX
"   Profit Margin = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Profit]), SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), 0)"
   ```

10. **High-Value Sales**
    ```DAX
"    High Value Sales = FILTER(Sales, Sales[SalesAmount] > 1000)"
    ```
