    "\n",
    "- **String (`str`)**: Represents a sequence of characters.  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  name = \"Alice\"  # A string\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List (`list`)**: An ordered collection of items that can be of different types.  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]  # A list\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuple (`tuple`)**: Similar to a list but immutable.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **Types of Literals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Literals:** Enclosed in quotes.  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Type Casting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type Casting** is converting one data type to another. Python provides functions to perform type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Converting integer to float\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = float(x)  # y will be 10.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting float to integer\n",
    "z = 3.99\n",
    "w = int(z)  # w will be 3 (fractional part is truncated)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting string to integer\n",
    "num_str = \"123\"\n",
    "num_int = int(num_str)  # num_int will be 123\n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting integer to string\n",
    "num = 456\n",
    "num_str = str(num)  # num_str will be \"456\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Functions for Type Casting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int()`: Converts a value to an integer.\n",
    "- `float()`: Converts a value to a float.\n",
    "- `str()`: Converts a value to a string.\n",
    "- `list()`, `tuple()`, `set()`: Convert other data types to lists, tuples, or sets respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Comments**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments** are used to explain code, making it more understandable for humans. They are ignored by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Comments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-Line Comment:** Begins with a `#`.  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # This is a single-line comment\n",
    "  x = 10  # Inline comment\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Line Comment:** Enclosed in triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`).  \n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "  It can span multiple lines.\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  x = 20\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use comments to explain the purpose of code sections.\n",
    "- Avoid unnecessary comments that do not add value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Command Line Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Line Arguments** allow you to pass information to a Python script when you execute it from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `sys.argv`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sys.argv` list in the `sys` module contains command line arguments passed to the script. The first item in `sys.argv` is the script name, and subsequent items are arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Script (`example.py`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the command line arguments\n",
    "print(\"Script name:\", sys.argv[0])\n",
    "print(\"Number of arguments:\", len(sys.argv) - 1)\n",

    "### **1. Indentation in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **indentation** is crucial as it defines the structure of code blocks. Unlike other programming languages that use braces `{}` or keywords to denote code blocks, Python uses indentation levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency:** The indentation must be consistent throughout the code block. You can use spaces or tabs, but mixing both within the same code block will lead to errors.\n",
    "- **Standard Practice:** It is common to use 4 spaces per indentation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Indented block\n",

    "Conditional statements are essential for:\n",
    "- **Decision Making:** Allow different actions based on varying conditions.\n",
    "- **Control Flow:** Determine the path of execution depending on dynamic conditions.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Respond to different states or inputs appropriately.\n",

    "\n",
    "Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They are essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. `range()` Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is commonly used in `for` loops. It can take one, two, or three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `range(stop)`: Generates numbers from `0` to `stop-1`.\n",
    "- `range(start, stop)`: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop-1`.\n",
    "- `range(start, stop, step)`: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop-1` with increments of `step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# range(stop)\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "# range(start, stop)\n",
    "for i in range(2, 6):\n",
    "    print(i)  # Output: 2 3 4 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# range(start, stop, step)\n",
    "for i in range(1, 10, 2):\n",
    "    print(i)  # Output: 1 3 5 7 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Need for Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are needed for:\n",
    "- **Repetitive Tasks:** Performing the same action multiple times without duplicating code.\n",
    "- **Iteration:** Processing items in a collection (like lists or tuples) one by one.\n",
    "- **Automation:** Automating repetitive operations like data processing, file manipulation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Automation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(\"This will print 5 times.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. `for` Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",

    "# Loop through a list\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with `range()`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loop through a range of numbers\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. `while` Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code block\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. `continue`, `break`, and `pass` Keywords**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`continue`:** Skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(5):\n",
    "      if i == 2:\n",
    "          continue\n",
    "      print(i)  # Output: 0 1 3 4\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`break`:** Exits the loop entirely, regardless of the loop's condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(5):\n",
    "      if i == 3:\n",
    "          break\n",
    "      print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pass`:** A placeholder that does nothing. It is used when a statement is syntactically required but you don’t want to execute any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(5):\n",
    "      if i == 2:\n",
    "          pass  # Do nothing\n",
    "      print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Nested Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop. The inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",

    "## **Functions in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Defining and Calling Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help in organizing code, reducing redundancy, and improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining a Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `def` keyword to define a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    # Code block\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function\n",
    "message = greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. `return` Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `return` statement is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. If no `return` statement is present, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Types of Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can accept different types of arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default Arguments:** Arguments that assume a default value if no value is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
    "      return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  print(greet())        # Output: Hello, Guest!\n",
    "  print(greet(\"Alice\")) # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable-Length Arguments:** Used to pass a variable number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **`*args` (Non-keyword Arguments):** Allows passing a variable number of positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def print_numbers(*args):\n",
    "        for number in args:\n",
    "            print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "    print_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **`**kwargs` (Keyword Arguments):** Allows passing a variable number of keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def print_info(**kwargs):\n",
    "        for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "            print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    print_info(name=\"Alice\", age=30, city=\"New York\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Variable Scope - Global vs Local**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Variables:** Defined within a function and accessible only within that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def my_function():\n",
    "      local_var = 10\n",
    "      print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "  my_function()  # Output: 10\n",
    "  # print(local_var)  # This would raise an error\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Variables:** Defined outside any function and accessible from any function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  global_var = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "  def my_function():\n",
    "      print(global_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "  my_function()  # Output: 20\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  To modify a global variable inside a function, use the `global` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  global_var = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "  def modify_global():\n",
    "      global global_var\n",
    "      global_var = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "  modify_global()\n",
    "  print(global_var)  # Output: 30\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Recursive Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **recursive function** is a function that calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It must have a base case to terminate recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example - Factorial Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Lambda Functions, `filter`, `map`, `reduce`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lambda Functions:** Anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "  print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`filter()` Function:** Filters elements from an iterable based on a function that returns `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "  even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "  print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`map()` Function:** Applies a function to all items in an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "  squares = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
    "  print(list(squares))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`reduce()` Function:** Applies a function cumulatively to items of an iterable, from left to right, reducing it to a single value. (Requires importing `functools`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "  sum_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
    "  print(sum_numbers)  # Output: 15\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Need of Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules help in organizing code into separate files, making it more manageable and reusable. They allow code to be divided into logical sections and help in avoiding code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Code Reusability:** Functions and classes can be reused across multiple programs.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update code in smaller chunks.\n",
    "- **Namespace Management:** Helps in avoiding name conflicts by grouping related functions and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. What is a Module**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is a file containing Python code, such as functions, classes, and variables, that can be imported into other Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `mymodule.py` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using a Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mymodule\n",
    "\n",
    "print(mymodule.greet(\"Alice\"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "print(mymodule.add(5, 3))       # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Built-in Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides many built-in modules that offer a variety of functionalities. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`math`:** Provides mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import math\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`os`:** Provides functions to interact with the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import os\n",
    "  print(os.getcwd())  # Output: Current working directory\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. User-Defined Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined modules are custom modules created by you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example - Creating a User-Defined Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `myfunctions.py` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "def cube(x):\n",

    "### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and programs. It is based on several key principles, each of which helps in organizing and structuring code more effectively. Here’s an in-depth look at the core features and concepts of OOP, including practical examples and real-world use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Features of OOP**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components.\n",
    "   - **Real-World Example:** A class representing a car can encapsulate attributes like `color` and `engine_status`, and methods like `start_engine()` and `stop_engine()`. Users interact with the car through these methods rather than accessing its attributes directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It simplifies interactions with complex systems.\n",
    "   - **Real-World Example:** When you use a smartphone, you interact with its screen, not with the complex circuitry inside it. The smartphone abstracts these details away from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy.\n",
    "   - **Real-World Example:** A `Truck` class can inherit from a `Vehicle` class. The `Truck` class will inherit features like `drive()` and `stop()` from `Vehicle` while adding its specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, despite having the same name.\n",
    "   - **Real-World Example:** The `draw()` method can be used for different shapes like circles, squares, and triangles. Each shape class will have its implementation of `draw()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Class, Attributes & Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class:**\n",
    "  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class ClassName:\n",
    "      # Class attributes and methods\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Dog:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "          self.name = name  # Attribute\n",
    "          self.breed = breed  # Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "      def bark(self):  # Method\n",
    "          return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:**\n",
    "  - Attributes are variables that belong to a class. They hold the state or data of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Dog:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "          self.name = name  # Attribute\n",
    "          self.breed = breed  # Attribute\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods:**\n",
    "  - Methods are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of the objects created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Dog:\n",
    "      def bark(self):  # Method\n",
    "          return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Constructor and Destructor**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor (`__init__` method):**\n",
    "  - The constructor is a special method called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Car:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "          self.make = make\n",
    "          self.model = model\n",
    "          self.year = year\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Destructor (`__del__` method):**\n",
    "  - The destructor is a special method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It cleans up any resources or performs cleanup actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Car:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "          self.make = make\n",
    "          self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "      def __del__(self):\n",
    "          print(f\"Car {self.make} {self.model} is being destroyed\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. The class inheriting is called the **child class** or **subclass**, and the class being inherited from is the **parent class** or **superclass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Subclass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # Additional attributes and methods\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        return \"Eating...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "print(dog.eat())  # Output: Eating...\n",
    "print(dog.bark())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Data Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction involves creating a simplified model of complex real-world entities by defining abstract classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and typically contain one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "print(cat.make_sound())  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It often involves overriding methods in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Tweet\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_animal_speak(animal):\n",
    "    print(animal.speak())\n",
    "\n",
    "bird = Bird()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "make_animal_speak(bird)  # Output: Tweet\n",
    "make_animal_speak(dog)   # Output: Woof\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The function `make_animal_speak()` calls the `speak()` method on any object passed to it. The actual method executed depends on the type of object, demonstrating polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Assignments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some assignments to practice OOP concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Class:**\n",
    "   - Design a `Book` class with attributes like `title`, `author`, and `price`. Include methods to display book details and apply a discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - Create a base class `Employee` with attributes `name` and `salary`. Derive classes `Manager` and `Developer` from it, each with additional attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction:**\n",
    "   - Implement an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`. Create derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that implement the `area()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - Create a base class `Shape` with a method `draw()`. Derive classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that override `draw()`. Use a list of `Shape` objects to call `draw()` on each shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Constructor and Destructor:**\n",
    "   - Design a class `Student` with attributes `name` and `grades`. Implement the constructor to initialize attributes and the destructor to print a message when the object is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example - `Book` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Book:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, title, author, price):\n",
    "        self.title = title\n",
    "        self.author = author\n",
    "        self.price = price\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_details(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Title: {self.title}, Author: {self.author}, Price: ${self.price}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def apply_discount(self, percentage):\n",
    "        self.price -= self.price * (percentage / 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "book = Book(\"Python Programming\", \"John Doe\", 29.99)\n",

    "### File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Handling** refers to the process of working with files to perform operations such as creating, reading, writing, and closing files. Python provides built-in functions and methods to handle these operations efficiently. File handling is essential for data storage, manipulation, and retrieval in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Modes to Open Files\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files in Python, you can open files in different modes depending on the operation you want to perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read Mode (`'r'`)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for reading. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write Mode (`'w'`)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its content is overwritten.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Append Mode (`'a'`)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for appending data. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Read and Write Mode (`'r+'`)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Write and Read Mode (`'w+'`)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for both writing and reading. If the file already exists, its content is overwritten.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Append and Read Mode (`'a+'`)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Binary Mode (`'b'`)**:\n",
    "   - Used for working with binary files like images, videos, etc. This mode is added to the above modes (e.g., `'rb'` for reading a binary file).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in Python, use the `open()` function, which takes the filename and mode as arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Open file in read mode\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `with` statement to open files, which automatically handles closing the file after the block is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    # Perform operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides multiple methods to read the content of a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`read()`**:\n",
    "   - Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       content = file.read()\n",
    "       print(content)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`readline()`**:\n",
    "   - Reads a single line from the file.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       line = file.readline()\n",
    "       print(line)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`readlines()`**:\n",
    "   - Reads all lines of the file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       lines = file.readlines()\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing to Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also provides methods to write data to files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`write()`**:\n",
    "   - Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`writelines()`**:\n",
    "   - Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       lines = ['Hello, World!\\n', 'Python File Handling\\n']\n",
    "       file.writelines(lines)\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing operations on a file, it is important to close it to free up system resources. This can be done using the `close()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "# Perform operations\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement is preferred as it automatically closes the file:\n",

    "    # Perform operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with File Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`tell()`**:\n",
    "   - Returns the current position of the file pointer.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.tell())  # Output: 0 (at the start)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`seek(offset, whence)`**:\n",
    "   - Moves the file pointer to a specified location.\n",
    "   - `offset`: The number of bytes to move.\n",
    "   - `whence`: The reference point (`0` = start of file, `1` = current position, `2` = end of file).\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       file.seek(5)  # Move to the 6th byte (0-based index)\n",

    "### Pickling & Unpickling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pickling** is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file or transmit it over a network. **Unpickling** is the inverse operation, where a byte stream is converted back into a Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pickling Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "   data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}\n",
