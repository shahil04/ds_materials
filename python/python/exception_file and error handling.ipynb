    "\n",
    "1. Read a text file (`sales.txt`) that contains records of book sales. Each record includes a book's title, the number of copies sold, and the price per copy.\n",
    "2. Calculate the total sales for each book and update a new file (`total_sales.txt`) with the results.\n",
    "3. If the input file does not exist, the program should raise an exception and handle it gracefully by informing the user.\n",
    "4. If any data in the file is corrupted (e.g., missing values, incorrect data types), the program should handle the error and skip that entry, logging the error to an error file (`errors.log`).\n",
    "5. If the program runs successfully, it should print a confirmation message stating how many records were processed successfully and how many had errors.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **File Existence Check:**\n",
    "   - The program first checks if `sales.txt` exists using `os.path.exists(input_file)`. If the file doesn't exist, it prints an error message and exits the function early.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Validation:**\n",
    "   - Each line is split into 3 parts: `title`, `quantity`, and `price`. If the line does not contain exactly 3 parts, it is considered an invalid format, and the error is logged in the `errors.log` file.\n",
    "   - For quantity, the program uses the `isdigit()` method to check if it’s a valid integer. For price, it uses the helper function `is_float()` to check if it’s a valid float. If either of these checks fails, the error is logged, and the program skips processing that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Helper Function (`is_float`):**\n",
    "   - The `is_float` function is used to check if a value can be converted to a float. This is done using a `try`/`except` block inside the helper function. This is the only place where `try`/`except` is used, but it is isolated and only for checking float conversion. If you need to completely avoid exceptions, you could attempt another method (such as regex or more specific checks).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Logging:**\n",
    "   - If a line is invalid due to incorrect data or formatting, the error is logged in the `errors.log` file with a description of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output File:**\n",
    "   - For valid data, the program calculates the total sales and writes the results to `total_sales.txt`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "In this approach, we avoid using `try`/`except` in the main logic flow and instead use conditional checks like `isdigit()` and a helper function to validate the input data. The only exception handling is in the `is_float()` helper function for checking float conversion, but you could substitute this with another non-exception-based method if necessary."

    "\n",
    "1. **No Log File:**\n",
    "   - We no longer write any errors to a separate log file. Instead, we **print error messages** directly to the console. This allows the user to see any issues with specific lines without creating a separate error log.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Error Handling through Console Output:**\n",
    "   - If a line doesn't match the expected format or contains invalid data (like a non-numeric quantity or price), the program **prints an error message** and **skips that line**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Skipping Invalid Lines:**\n",
    "   - Invalid lines are not processed or written to the output file (`total_sales.txt`). The program will continue with the next line without halting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No `try`/`except` for Main Code Logic:**\n",
    "   - The code avoids `try`/`except` for handling the file operations and data validation. Only a small helper function (`is_float`) still uses `try`/`except`, but this is isolated and could be modified to use a different approach if needed.\n",
